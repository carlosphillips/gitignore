# git ignore parser and matcher for Go
 
The module implements matching file system paths to gitignore patterns that can be automatically read from 
  a git repository tree in the order of definition priorities. It support all pattern formats as specified
  in the original `gitignore` documentation, copied below:

## Pattern format

* A blank line matches no files, so it can serve as a separator for readability.

* A line starting with # serves as a comment. Put a backslash ("\\") 
in front of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash.

* Trailing spaces are ignored unless they are quoted with backslash ("\\").

* An optional prefix "!" which negates the pattern; any matching file excluded 
by a previous pattern will become included again. It is not possible to 
re-include a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded. 
Git doesnâ€™t list excluded directories for performance reasons, so 
any patterns on contained files have no effect, no matter where they are 
defined. Put a backslash ("\\") in front of the first "!" for patterns 
that begin with a literal "!", for example, "\\!important!.txt".

* If the pattern ends with a slash, it is removed for the purpose of the 
following description, but it would only find a match with a directory. 
In other words, foo/ will match a directory foo and paths underneath it, 
but will not match a regular file or a symbolic link foo (this is consistent 
with the way how pathspec works in general in Git).

* If the pattern does not contain a slash /, Git treats it as a shell glob 
pattern and checks for a match against the pathname relative to the location 
of the .gitignore file (relative to the toplevel of the work tree if not 
from a .gitignore file).

* Otherwise, Git treats the pattern as a shell glob suitable for consumption 
by fnmatch(3) with the FNM_PATHNAME flag: wildcards in the pattern will 
not match a / in the pathname. For example, "Documentation/*.html" matches 
"Documentation/git.html" but not "Documentation/ppc/ppc.html" or 
"tools/perf/Documentation/perf.html".

* A leading slash matches the beginning of the pathname. For example, 
"/*.c" matches "cat-file.c" but not "mozilla-sha1/sha1.c".

Two consecutive asterisks ("**") in patterns matched against full pathname 
may have special meaning:

* A leading "\*\*" followed by a slash means match in all directories. 
For example, "\*\*/foo" matches file or directory "foo" anywhere, the same as 
pattern "foo". "**/foo/bar" matches file or directory "bar" 
anywhere that is directly under directory "foo".

* A trailing "/\*\*" matches everything inside. For example, "abc/**" matches 
all files inside directory "abc", relative to the location of the 
.gitignore file, with infinite depth.

* A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches 
zero or more directories. For example, "a/**/b" matches "a/b", "a/x/b", 
"a/x/y/b" and so on.

* Other consecutive asterisks are considered invalid.
